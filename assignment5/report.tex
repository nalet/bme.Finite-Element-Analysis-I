\section*{Abstract}
In this assignment, we examine the behavior of a metal plate under compression.
A rigid press, modeled as a 3D shell, squeezes the plate together.
By retrieving the force and displacement values over time, we can determine the plastic behavior 
of our specimen. In this assignment, we use the findings from the previous assignment 4 and 
instead of using a Lagrangian formulation we are using a Eulerian.

\section{Introduction}
Like in the previous assignment 4, the plate is compressed from both sides. Symmetry is used to keeep
computation time low. 
Eulerian modeling can only be done on 3D models. As the previous model was in 2D, 
for this assignment we remodeled the parts in 3D. We use the same material coefficients
as in the previous assignment. 
Despite using 3D-modelling, our specimen consits of only one element in depth
with encastered front and back surfaces. The behaviour is therefore
2D-alike.

  \caption{Model of the plate with Eulerian formulation}
  \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

\noindent As shown in Figure \ref{fig:1}, the model of the plate has to be partitioned. 
We have to anticipate the final distribution of the material (white ares), as Abaqus needs us to define the are/volume 
where the original material (shaded area) will be "flowing" during simulation. 
Again, only a quarter of the model has to be sketched due to symmetry.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian Analysis in Abacus}

In this assignment we used eularian parts. The most obvious difference to the previous Lagrangian
simulations is the behaviour of the mesh during simulation. Whereas lagrangian meshes deform and compress 
with the part, eularian meshes stay intact. This, however, needs to be taken into account 
when meshing the part in the first place, as there has to be enough "meshed space" around the model,
where the material can flow into. This material flow is then measured to draw conclusions
about the material characteristics.

\section{Results and Discussion}

The gained results from the eularian simulation are similar to the lagrangian results from the 
prvious assignment. Both simulations, with or without friction, lie in the region
of stress/strain ratio as in assignment 4.
